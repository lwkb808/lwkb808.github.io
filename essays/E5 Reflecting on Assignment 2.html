  <p><h2>1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2_retrospective.html">link<a> to this page for further details&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Assigment 2 improved upon the online shop I made in Assingment 1 by adding a login and registration feature. Utilizing the fs package from node in my code users are able to add their login information (email, full name and password) to a .json file. Once their login data is logged into the .json users are able to sign-in and compelete their purchase.</p>

<p><h2>2. What did you learn from this assignment?</h2></p>

<p>This assignment taught me the importance of writing out a plan creating my codeto help me vizualize what I need to do. Having a little roadmap kept me on task and made things a little easier. Another thing I learned is to use ChatGPT wisely. Instead of asking for code I began to use it as a tool to help fill my knowledge gap rather than replace my knowledge.</p>

<p><h2>3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).&lt;/p&gt;</h2>

<p>I didn't have a partner to work with in Assignment 2, but I did recieve help from Professor Port to clean up my code.<p>

<p><h2>4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?&lt;/p&gt;</h2>

<p>My main area was help with fixing my code to add new user data to the .json file. I was able to get help from Professor Port. He also helped me to get my errors to display on webpage whenever users didn't format their information correctly (password not long enough, email not formatted correctly, etc).</p>

<p><h2>5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?&lt;/p&gt;</h2>

<p>The development for Assignment 2 became a little more complex because we needed to actually add data to a file rather than storing data on the server that edited (adding login info vs editing quantity data on the server).</p>

<p><h2>6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging&lt;/p&gt;</h2>

<p>40% thinking about how to do something. 20% writing the code. 40% debugging the code.</p>

<p><h2>7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?&lt;/p&gt;</h2>

<p>Formatting the login/registration page for this assignment went very well. The hardest part of this assignment was learning how to use the fs package. Finding a way to utilize this package correctly left me contemplating a lot more than the last assignment.</p>

<p><h2>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?&lt;/p&gt;</h2>

<p>I would take more time to plan and do research. It always feels like a project is 75% preparation and 25% execution.</p>
