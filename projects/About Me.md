Aloha everyone! My name is Levi, I'm a super senior who recently decided to double major in MIS to compliment my Marketing degree.

I started my college career at UH firmly believeing that Marketing was the area for me. Recently, I've felt that I want more than just Marketing, and MIS became that more. I found that MIS can fulfill my want to problem solve and get creative. Plus, after doing a little market research I found their are hybrid jobs that utilize both Marketing and MIS skills, such as a Marketing Technologist. 

I'm excited to my path where ever MIS takes me and to hopefully meet all of you! If I can give one piece of advice from being in college for so long (and its been quite a long time) it would be trust the process, theres no standard for when you need to graduate everyone is at their own pace.
