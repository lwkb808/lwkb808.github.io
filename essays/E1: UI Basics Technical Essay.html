  <p>WODs are an interesting way to learn to code. I’ve heard of project style learning in the coding community before taking ITM 352, but I didn’t think it would be this difficult, AT FIRST. BrowserHistory1 was my first WOD and it definitely took me about four to five tries. I was behind on my reading a bit so I struggled, and I am a bit stubborn so I try not to look at the screencast unless necessary. My biggest challenge was learning the syntax for referencing images. My second biggest hurdle was finding a decent software to screen record myself. I still didn’t figure out zoom worked perfectly for screen recording until BrowserHistory3. Before BrowserHistory3, my screencasts would only focus on one window and I had no idea that the program I was using wasn’t recording voice. Aside from technical issues I feel that WODs are very beneficial. I am able to put my skills to the test with some added pressure of a time limit.</p>

<p>My best piece of advice is to make sure you have a reliable screen recording software. Any software that renders adequate videos in a reasonable amount of time and records your voice should be just fine for this semester. Also, the readings are your life-line without them this class is nearly impossible to complete so give yourself time to digest the material.</p>
