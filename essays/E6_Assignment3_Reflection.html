  <h2>1. Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</h2>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>My system is an online store that specializes in selling six different vape, flower and gummy products. 
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2>2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</h2>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The biggest shortcoming is that I wasn't able to use the nodemailer module in my code and I had an issue with updating product quantities as when addedto the cart.
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2>3. Describe what you are most proud of about your system</h2>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I am most proud of updating my website to look like a legit website rather than a copy of the store made in class.
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2>4. Describe what you are least happy with your system:</h2>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>My system only allows users remove items rather than giving the option for users to choose how much they wanted to add or reduce their orderby in the cart
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2>5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</h2>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Assignment 3 had so many moving parts it became hard to keep track of what parts fit into each other. A good portion of my time was spent making sure variables weren't mispelled.
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2>6. When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</h2>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Ideally I would've tried using the debugger instead I used a combination of inspecting the webpage and looking at the output in the terminal on VS code.
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2>7. Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</h2>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Implementing the cookies and sessions modules tested my patience but ultimately they both added a lot of value to my system. Allowing for data to be stored via cookie or session is a convinient way to take data from webpage to webpage without adding a cray amount of code.
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2>8. Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</h2>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The nodemailer module was a beast I could not conquer due to a lack of task management. I definitely needed to start earlier to implement all my ideas for the system.
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2>9. What did you learn from doing this assignment?</h2>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>One thing that will be forever ingrained into me is the majority of my mistakes are so stupid they can be fixed by renaming a variable, but I'll always think my mistakes are way bigger than they really are.
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2>10. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</h2>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Plan. Plan. Plan. Assingment 3 is difficult but it is manigable with proper task management. Since I am still a novice I tend to underestimate coding projects which ends up being my downfall.
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2>11. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h2>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>40% thinking, 20% writing code, 40% debugging and 10% looking for snacks. Because I always give 110%!
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2>12. Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)</h2>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>100% me I did all the coding besides the help I got in prior assingments.
</code></pre></div></div>
